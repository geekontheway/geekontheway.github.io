>CentOS 5

- Installing MySQL

{% highlight ruby %}
yum install mysql-server
/sbin/chkconfig --levels 235 mysqld on
{% endhighlight %}

The MySQL server package will be installed on your server, **along with dependencies and client libraries.** Start MySQL by running the following command:

`service mysqld start`

- Configuring MySQL

After installing MySQL, it's recommended that you run **mysql_secure_installation**, a program that helps secure MySQL. While running mysql_secure_installation, **you will be presented with the opportunity to change the MySQL root password, remove anonymous user accounts, disable root logins outside of localhost, and remove test databases.** It is recommended that you answer yes to these options. If you are prompted to reload the privilege tables, select yes.


By default, MySQL makes some assumptions about your server environment with respect to memory. To configure MySQL more conservatively, you'll need to edit some settings in its configuration file. Your file should resemble the following:

`File:/etc/my.cnf`

{% highlight ruby %}
[mysqld]
datadir=/var/lib/mysql
socket=/var/lib/mysql/mysql.sock
user=mysql
# Default to using old password format for compatibility with mysql 3.x
# clients (those using the mysqlclient10 compatibility package).
old_passwords=1

# Disabling symbolic-links is recommended to prevent assorted security risks;
# to do so, uncomment this line:
# symbolic-links=0

key_buffer = 16K
max_allowed_packet = 1M
thread_stack = 64K
table_cache = 4
sort_buffer = 64K
net_buffer_length = 2K
bind-address = 127.0.0.1

[mysqld_safe]
log-error=/var/log/mysqld.log
pid-file=/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.pid
These settings are only suggested values for a low memory environment; please feel free to tune them to appropriate values for your server. Consult the "More Information" section at the end of this tutorial for additional resources for this topic.
{% endhighlight %}

<!-- more -->
If you made any changes to MySQL's configuration, issue the following command to restart it:

`service mysqld restart`

MySQL will bind to localhost (127.0.0.1) by default. Please reference our secure MySQL remote access guide for information on connecting to your databases with local clients.

Allowing unrestricted access to MySQL on a public IP not advised, but you may change the address it listens on by modifying the bind-address parameter. If you decide to bind MySQL to your public IP, **you should implement firewall rules that only allow connections from specific IP addresses.
**

- Resetting the MySQL Root Password
If you've forgotten your root MySQL password, you may recover it by issuing the following commands:

{% highlight ruby %}
/etc/init.d/mysqld stop
mysqld_safe --skip-grant-tables &
mysql -u root
{% endhighlight %}

The following part of the password reset will now be done within the MySQL client program:

{% highlight ruby %}
USE mysql;
UPDATE user SET PASSWORD=PASSWORD("CHANGEME") WHERE USER='root';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
exit

{% endhighlight %}

Last, restart MySQL by issuing:

{% highlight ruby %}
service mysqld restart
{% endhighlight %}

GUI: PHPMyAdmin
